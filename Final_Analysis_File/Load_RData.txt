Thanks for the tip James. 

A few people (including myself) were having issues loading Sekhar's file. He posted the file on the discussion boards so I loaded the file into R and saved it as .Rdata file.



data.awards <- read.csv(file="Awards_File.csv", header=T)
save(data.awards, file="Awards.Data.RData")

load("Awards.Data.RData")

View(data.awards)



Hope that helps
