IS607 Project-3 Summary
========================================================
author: Is Best Film Editing is the best predictor of Best Picture ?

Analysis 1 - Points based approach
========================================================
[Refer Complete Analysis](https://rpubs.com/senthiltamil/Project3)

- *If Best Picture movie was also nominated on other categories then those categories get one point*
- *If the BEST Picture movie also won in other categories then those categories get two points. Categories with most points are the best indicators or predictors of Best picture movie.*

__Conclusion: Directing Category can be used a good indicator to PREDICT the BEST PICTURE.__


Analysis 2 - Using 'Bayes' formula
========================================================

========================================================
Overall Conclusion

- __Majority of our analysis concludes that the Best Film Editing is NOT the best predictor of Best Picture__
