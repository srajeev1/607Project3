Data Visualization for the IS607 Project No. 2 | CUNY MSDA 

Load data
```{r}
load("Awards.Data.RData")

#View(data.awards)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

# Create BP.won, a dataframe showing only Best Picture Winners
BP <- filter(data.awards, category_name == "BEST PICTURE", won == 1)

# Create BP.AlsoNom, a dataframe showing what other categories the Best Picture Winners were NOMINATED for
BP.AlsoNom <- left_join(BP, data.awards, by = "movie_name")
BP.AlsoNom.cat <- filter(BP.AlsoNom, category_name.y != "BEST PICTURE") 
BP.AlsoNom.cat <- select(BP.AlsoNom.cat, category_name.y) 

# Create BP.AlsoWon, a dataframe showing what other categories the Best Picture winners WON
data.awards.won <- filter(data.awards, won == 1)
BP.AlsoWon <- left_join(BP, data.awards.won, by = "movie_name")
BP.AlsoWon <- distinct(BP.AlsoWon)
```


## Exploratory Data Analysis
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

#Table 1 - Categories Also Nominated for Best Picture Winners

```{r}
summary(BP.AlsoNom.cat)
```

#Figure 1
Answers question "Each year's best picture winner was also nominated in: Editing Category X% of the time,
Cinematography Y% of the time, Best Score Z% of the time... visualized as a bar chart in decending order
```{r}
#this needs some work 1. arrange from highest to lowest, somehow resolve names?
ggplot(data = BP.AlsoNom.cat, aes(x = category_name.y)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) 

```
